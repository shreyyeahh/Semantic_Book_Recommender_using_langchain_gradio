# Semantic Book Recommender using LangChain and Gradio

A book recommender system that uses semantic search to recommend books based on user input. This project is built using LangChain and Gradio.

## üìñ About the Project

This project is a book recommender system that goes beyond simple keyword matching. It uses semantic search to understand the user's query and recommend books that are contextually similar. The user can input a query, and the system will return a list of recommended books with their covers and other details.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Semantic Search:** Understands the user's query contextually to provide relevant recommendations.
* **Gradio Interface:** A simple and intuitive user interface built with Gradio to interact with the recommender system.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes the sentiment of book descriptions.
* **Text Classification:** Classifies books into different categories.
* **Vector-based Search:** Uses vector embeddings for efficient and accurate book retrieval.
